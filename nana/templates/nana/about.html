Begin by carefully selecting a clear, concise thesis statement that defines the central argument.

Enhance the essay by incorporating strong evidence, examples, and quotes that support the argument, making sure to properly cite sources. Eliminate any redundant or irrelevant information to keep the writing concise and focused.

Additionally, refine the language and sentence structure for readability, aiming for varied sentence lengths and avoiding overly complex phrasing. Use transition words to ensure smooth connections between ideas. Finally, check for grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors to ensure professionalism and accuracy. Optimizing an essay also involves revising and refining multiple drafts to ensure the argument is presented in the most effective way possible.</h6>
